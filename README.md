# cg-controller

##Game controller standard
The following is proposed logic for the controller:

* Button 1 = t (A single button on top of the controller used to toggle game on / off)
* Button 2 = q (Generally used to move left or move something up)
* Button 3 = e (Generally used to move right or something down)

##Energy reader (stepper/wheel)
At present this has been hacked to work with pre-existing games which require a key press type
action.

A better solution will be to return the RPMs allowing the game the freedom to decide what to do with the input.
